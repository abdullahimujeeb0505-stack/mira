# Hello HTTP server

A minimal TypeScript HTTP server using Node.js built-ins only.

Run it from the workspace root:

```sh
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run hello-server
```

It listens on port `3000` by default. Set `PORT` to use a different port.
Send an HTTP request to `/` and it responds with `Hello`.

## Groq API test

With the `GROK_API_CODING_KEY` secret configured, run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run groq-api-test
```

The script sends `Reply with exactly: GROQ WORKS` to Groq's Responses API using `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and prints the model response.
